The IBM Capstone Project marks the culmination of my IBM Data Analyst Specialization course (IBM, Issued January 2025, Credential ID: KZL0GQ6WY5R3). In this project, I analyzed the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to identify and assess trends in programming skills, providing insights into the current and future interests of developers.

I utilized Python in Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing, and created interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos to visualize the data. The detailed findings and analysis are summarized in the PDF document MehlikaOZsoy_capstone.pdf, while the associated project code can be found in the project repository.

The dashboard can be accessed here:
